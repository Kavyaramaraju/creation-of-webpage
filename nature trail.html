        <p>
            The physical world and the inner soul constitute nature, the ultimate source of our living. 
            Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. 
            Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. 
            It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components. 
            But, deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature.<br><br> 
            In addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. 
            It is now more essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones. 
            People from all over the world should join forces to relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance.
             It is now the most essential aim to serve our nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.
